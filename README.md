### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Max. What is yours?

I recently graduated from RWTH with an M.Sc. in Data Science. Before, I studied physics in Aachen as well. Additionally, I am one of the founders of
[@QuITAC](https://github.com/QuITAC), a student club aiming to provide cloud software to another student club, the _Queerreferat an den Aachener Hochschulen e. V._
This profile is for my personal coding stuff. Due to my studies I am quite proficient in `python`, therefore most repositories you will find
on this profile will contain `python` code. If you want to look at a good example of my coding skills take a gander at [my YT playlist breaker](https://github.com/DSMaVie/playlist-breaker).
A more lengthy and definietly more rushed example would be [my thesis code](https://github.com/DSMaVie/ser-explo).

If you have any questions you can contact me via _max [dot] vieweg [at] outlook [dot] com_.

### Technologies I'd like to work with

As my current skill set is quite high-level (in terms of coding languages) I'd like to expand my skill set towards/ Some more low-level languages I am thrilled about would be:
* `Rust`
* `C/C++`
* `MoJo`

Additionally, I find the follwoing python libraries thrilling and would love the chance to work with them:
* [Pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi)
* [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax)
* [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)

If you have any idea about what to code in those (as a chill learner's project) feel free to send it to me.
